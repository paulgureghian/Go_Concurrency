# Go_Concurrency

Taking advantage of the processing power of today's multi-core computers is a challenge that every developer faces. In this demo, I will implement Concurrent Programming with Go, I will leverage the ability of Go's powerful tools that allow multi-threaded programs to be written in a clear, easily understood manner. First, I will demo how to use goroutines to initiate concurrent tasks. Then, I will explore the sync package and demo how to use it to coordinate goroutines. Finally, I will demo channels and how they compliment and complete the coordination features of the sync package. When I am finished with this program, I will have demoed my skills and knowledge of Go's concurrency model needed to write safely, highly concurrent applications.
